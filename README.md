# MySecurePass: Your Temporary Password Haven

Welcome to MySecurePass, a sleek and intuitive password manager designed to keep your credentials organized and accessible. Currently, MySecurePass offers a **clean and appealing user interface** that prioritizes a smooth experience for managing your passwords.

## How It Works (For Now)

MySecurePass currently stores all your sensitive data in **temporary memory**. This means your passwords are secure for the duration of your session but are not persistently saved. It's a great way to manage your passwords quickly and efficiently during active use.

## What's Next? (The Exciting Part!)

This is just the beginning for MySecurePass! I'm actively working on significant upgrades to transform it into a robust and highly secure solution:

* **Authentication & User Accounts:** Soon, you'll be able to create your own secure account. This means **only you will have access to your personal passwords**, ensuring complete privacy and control.
* **Database Integration:** I'll be integrating a secure database to ensure your passwords are **persistently stored and safely retrieved** across sessions. No more temporary memory â€“ your data will be there when you need it!

Stay tuned for updates as MySecurePass evolves into your ultimate secure password management solution!
